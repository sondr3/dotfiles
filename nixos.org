* Introduction
I had heard lots of great things about Nix and NixOS from both reddit and HN,
but never really had a good opportunity to find a use case for it. I've used
CentOS and Debian on my servers, and have tried quite a few distros over the
years for both my old desktops and laptops. I used Arch for a few months but
managed to completely mess it up by trying to fix some driver related issues
with Nvidia and it just did /not/ work. So I figured now was a good a time as any
to try something new since I had to reinstall Linux anyways. So, NixOS.

I do have to say it's been a great experience, the installation was a bit
confusing but that was mostly because I had to install it on top of an existing
installation as I had ~/home~ partition that I didn't want to override. But some
asking on IRC and I was off.

For someone who is used to having to play around with tons of configuration
files all over the system NixOS is amazing. When I ran Arch I would have issues
where I'd misconfigure Xorg and it would boot to a black screen. Then you'd have
to boot into rescue mode, find the file you edited and change it back and reboot
and hope you did it right. With NixOS you make a change to your
~configuration.nix~ and reboot. Doesn't work? No matter, the previous build of
NixOS is available on the boot so you can incredibly easily roll back to your
previous working configuration. No more worries over your system going haywire
because of configuration mishaps!

So, without further ado: my NixOS configuration.

* Jupiter
Jupiter is the name of my MacBook Pro 10,1 (Retina mid-2012) that I run NixOS
on.

** Imports and hardware
Should be pretty self-explanatory. The hardware configuration is automatically
created for you so you shouldn't have to edit it unless you really know what you
are doing.

#+BEGIN_SRC nix
  { config, pkgs, ... }:

  {
    imports =
      [ # Include the results of the hardware scan.
      ./hardware-configuration.nix
    ];
#+END_SRC

** Boot
| *Option*                   | *Value*                              | *Description*                                                              |
|--------------------------+------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ~kernelModules~            | ~applesmc~                           | Required to load the various sensors and controls included in Intel Macs |
| ~cleanTmpDir~              | ~true~                               | Cleans the ~/tmp~ directory on every boot                                  |
| ~extraModprobeConfig~      | ~options snd-hda-intel model=mbp101~ | Used to make sure audio works properly on a MacBook                      |
| ~systemd-boot.enable~      | ~true~                               | Use ~systemd-boot~ instead of Grub etc                                     |
| ~efi.canTouchEfiVariables~ | ~true~                               | Used to make sure the boot loader can touch EFI variables                |

#+BEGIN_SRC nix
  boot = {
    kernelModules = ["applesmc"];
    cleanTmpDir = true;
    extraModprobeConfig = ''
      options snd-hda-intel model=mbp101
    '';

    loader = {
      systemd-boot.enable = true;
      efi.canTouchEfiVariables = true;
    };
  };
#+END_SRC

** Hardware
Nothing too out of the ordinary here, we enable Bluetooth and PulseAudio because
who doesn't want either of those.

| *Option*                    | *Value*               | *Description*                                                                                  |
|---------------------------+---------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ~bluetooth.enable~          | ~true~                | Enables Bluetooth                                                                            |
| ~pulseaudio.enable~         | ~true~                | Enable PulseAudio                                                                            |
| ~pulseaudio.package~        | ~pkgs.pulseaudioFull~ | We have to use the ~Full~ package to enable support for Bluetooth in PulseAudio                |
| ~cpu.intel.updateMicrocode~ | ~true~                | Include updates to the microcode for Intel processors                                        |
| ~enableAllFirmware~         | ~true~                | Enables all the /other/ firmware, only useful if something doesn't work (but I use it anyways) |

#+BEGIN_SRC nix
  hardware = {
    bluetooth.enable = true;
    pulseaudio.enable = true;
    pulseaudio.package = pkgs.pulseaudioFull;
    cpu.intel.updateMicrocode = true;
    enableAllFirmware = true;
  };
#+END_SRC

** Networking
Same as above, just a straight forward configuration of it.

| *Option*            | *Value*   | *Description*                                                                |
|-------------------+---------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ~hostName~          | ~jupiter~ | The name of my laptop, all my electronics are named after planets or stars |
| ~connman.enable~    | ~true~    | Use ConnMan to configure wireless connections                              |
| ~enableB43Firmware~ | ~true~    | Must be enabled to install wireless drivers for the card in my MacBook     |

#+BEGIN_SRC nix
  networking = {
    hostName = "jupiter";
    connman.enable = true;
    enableB43Firmware = true;
  };
#+END_SRC
