# `dotfiles`

> These are my dotfiles, there are many like them but these ones are mine.

## What

My collection of dotfiles (very WIP after declaring dotfile bankruptcy in 2021)
for a minimal Arch with Sway machine.

## How?

If you absolutely need to use these dotfiles you should either just copy what
you want from the various files, but if for whatever reason you just absolutely
_have_ to have them all you can run `chezmoi init --apply sondr3`.
